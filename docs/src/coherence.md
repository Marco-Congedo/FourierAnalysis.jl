## coherence estimates

**frequency domain (FD)**

In the FD, the input is a continuous multivariate data matrix
``X=[x_1 ... x_n]``,
where each column is a series (e.g., a time-series).
Coherence estimates take the form of a ``n``x``n`` coherence matrix ``C(f)``
for each discrete Fourier frequency ``f``. Those are
normalized versions of the ``n``x``n`` *cross-spectral matrices* ``S(f)``
at corresponding frequencies.

Cross-spectral matrices are estimated
via a [Welch procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_method),
that is, they are averaged across windows sliding
over ``X``. The windows may be overlapping or not. Let ``Y_l(f)`` be the discrete Fourier transform at discrete
Fourier frequency ``f`` of the ``l^{th}`` window of ``X``.
The cross-spectral matrix estimation at frequency ``f`` is then given by

``S(f)=\left<Y(f)Y(f)^H\right>``,

where the average is taken across a number of sliding windows.

Therefore, coherence matrices in the FD is a measure of the
*synchronization between all ``n`` series of ``X`` taken pair-wise*,
resulting in a symmetric matrix for each discrete Fourier frequency.

**time-frequency domain (TFD)**

There exist many time-frequency representation, *e.g.*, those obtained
using [wavelets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet),
[short-time Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform), etc.
In *FourierAnalysis* time-frequency representations are obtained passing
a univariate signal through a
[filter bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bank)
and computing the
[analytic signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_signal)
of the filter output via the
[Hilbert transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_transform).
This results in a matrix with the band-pass regions of the filer bank in rows and the ``t`` time samples in columns (see [`filterbank`](@ref) and
[`analyticsignal`](@ref) for details).

For estimating coherence in the TFD, the input is composed of two sets of ``k``
univariate data vectors
``ùê±_a=\{x_{a1}, x_{a2},...,x_{ak}\}`` and ``ùê±_b=\{x_{b1}, x_{b2},...,x_{bk}\}``,
where each element of the set is to be understood as a single window holding
``t`` samples and where the elements in corresponding positions forms pairs.
Let ``Y_r(a)`` and ``Y_r(b)`` be the time-frequency analytic signal
of pairs ``x_{ar}``, ``x_{br}``, for all ``r=1...k``.
Coherence estimates also have a time-frequency representation.
They are a normalized version of crossed analytic signals, which
are analogous to cross-spectra and in a time-frequency plane are given by

``Z=\left<Y(a) \odot Y(b)^*\right>``,

where the average is taken across the ``k`` pairs (realizations).

Therefore, the coherence matrix in the TFD is a measure of the
*synchronization between pairs ``ùê±_a``, ``ùê±_b``* for each point in the time-frequency plane.

### kinds of coherence

*FourierAnalysis* estimates several kinds of *linear* and *non-linear*
squared coherences, simply referred to as *coherence*.
Let ``i`` and ``j`` indicate two time series,
``\left<s_{ij}\right>``
be an average cross-spectrum between
``i`` and ``j``, and ``\left<s_{i}\right>``, ``\left<s_{j}\right>``
be the auto-spectrum of ``i`` , ``j``. In the frequency domain those
are function of frequency, whereas in the time-frequency domain they are
functions of both time and frequency.

Finally, for time-frequency data non-negative weights may applied for the pairs on which the averages are computed.
Setting all weights equal to 1, gives the unweighted version
of all measures, which is the only supported option in the FD, since
therein the average is taken across windows and since windows segmentation is arbitrary, weighting is usually meaningless. In the formula below weights are ignored.

All kinds of coherences estimated in *FourierAnalysis* are summarized
in the following table:

|   kind         |                linear                       |              non-linear              |
|---------------:|:-------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|
|    *total*     | ``\left<\mid s_{ij} \mid^2\right>\big /\big(\left<s_i\right>\left<s_j\right>\big)`` | ``\left<\mid s_{ij} \mid^2\right>``  |
|    *real*      | ``\left<\mid \Bbb R(s_{ij}) \mid^2\right>\big/\big(\left<s_i\right>\left<s_j\right>\big)`` | ``\left<\mid \Bbb R(s_{ij})\mid^2\right>`` |
|  *imaginary*   | ``\left<\mid \Bbb C(s_{ij}) \mid^2\right>\big/\big(\left<s_i\right>\left<s_j\right>\big)`` | ``\left<\mid \Bbb C(s_{ij}) \mid^2\right>`` |
| *instantaneous*| ``\left<\mid \Bbb R(s_{ij}) \mid^2\right>\big/\big(\left<s_i\right>\left<s_j\right>-\left<\mid \Bbb C(s_{ij}) \mid^2\right>\big)`` | ``\left<\mid \Bbb R(s_{ij}) \mid^2\right>\big/\big(1-\left<\mid \Bbb C(s_{ij}) \mid^2\right>\big)`` |
|   *lagged*     | ``\left<\mid \Bbb C(s_{ij}) \mid^2\right>\big/\big(\left<s_i\right>\left<s_j\right>-\left<\mid \Bbb R(s_{ij}) \mid^2\right>\big)`` | ``\left<\mid \Bbb C(s_{ij}) \mid^2\right>\big/\big(1-\left<\mid \Bbb R(s_{ij}) \mid^2\right>\big)`` |

The *linear* **total**  coherence is the classical *squared coherence* measure
and its *non-linear* counterpart is known as *phase-locking value* or
*phase coherence*.

The **real** coherence (Pascual-Marqui, 2007) and the
**imaginary** coherence (Nolte *et al.*, 2004), sum up to the total coherence.

The **lagged** coherence has been proposed by Pascual-Marqui (2007).
As a completion of the table, we here also define the **instantaneous**
coherence in an analogous way.

Corresponding *linear* and *non-linear* measures are the same, but are computed
on linear and non-linear cross-spectra in the FD and crossed analytic-signal in the TFD, respectively.
In fact, the non-linear expressions are obtained setting ``s_i=s_j=1``,
which is the case for non-linear cross-spectra and analytic signals. See
[CrossSpectra](@ref) and [TFAnalyticSignal](@ref).
For further explanations on the linearity of those objects, see Congedo (2018).

### interpreting coherence

The real part of the cross-spectrum, named the *co-spectrum*, describes the
*synchronous* synchronization, that is, in-phase synchronization or
out-of-phase synchronization. The imaginary part, named the
*quadrature spectrum*, describes the *asynchronous* synchronization,
that is, with a quarter of a cycle lead or lag (see Congedo, 2018).
Consequently,
- the *total* coherence is sensitive to all kinds of synchronization,
- the *real* coherence is sensitive only to synchronous synchronization,
- the *instantaneous* coherence is sensitive to all but asynchronous synchronization,
- the *imaginary* coherence is sensitive only to asynchronous synchronization,
- the *lagged* coherence is sensitive to all but synchronous synchronization.

## Coherence

**Categories**: [data objects](@ref), [FDobjects](@ref)

In the time-frequency domain coherence estimates are given as Julia ``Matrix``
objects. In the frequency-domain they are encapsulated in the
following structure:

```julia
struct Coherence
   <same fields of the CrossSpectra structure>
end
```

This object has the same structure of the [CrossSpectra](@ref) object,
with the difference that its `y` data field holds real matrices,
whereas for cross-spectra holds complex matrices.

By convention the diagonal elements of all FD coherence matrices are
filled with 1.0. Note that the FFT coefficients for the DC level
and the Nyquist frequency are real, therefore for those frequencies the
identity matrix is returned for the *imaginary* and *lagged* coherence.
Also, note that at these frequencies the *instantaneous* coherence is equal
to the *real* coherence. In the time-frequency domain,
we do not have discrete frequencies but a filter bank,
thus no special behavior appears at the edges.

A vector of *Coherence* objects is of type [CoherenceVector](@ref).

**Methods for Coherence and CoherenceVector objects**

**Generic Constructors**:

In order to construct a *Coherence* object in the frequency domain from
multivariate data, *FourierAnalysis* provides two [`coherence`](@ref)
constuctors from raw data and two constuctors building coherence matrices
from [CrossSpectra](@ref) and [CrossSpectraVector](@ref) objects.
Those are what you will use in practice most of the time.

Manual constructors are also possible, for which you have to provide
appropriate arguments. Generic constructors follow exactly the same syntax
as the generic constructors of [CrossSpectra](@ref) objects.

In order to estimate coherence in the time-frequency domain from
sets of univariate data, *FourierAnalysis* provides two more
[`coherence`](@ref) functions.
