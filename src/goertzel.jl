# ? CONTENTS :
#   This unit implements Goertzel's algorithms for estimating
#   DFT complex coefficients at a specific frequency
#   in the time domain for FFT analysis.
#   NB: The result is practically identical to the output of an FFT,
#   but requieres only `t` operations, where `t` is the window length
#   and is not restricted to a discrete Fourier Frequency.
#   Since the complexity of FFT algirthms is t*log(t), Goertzels' algorithm
#   are advantageous when only one or a few coefficients are needed.
#   Smart block on-line implementations are also possible.

function goertzel( x   :: AbstractVector{T},
                   f   :: IntOrReal,
                   sr  :: Int,
                   wl  :: Int,
               startAT :: Int = 1) where T<:Union{Real, Complex}
```

Given a time series as input vector `x` sampled at `sr` sampling rate,
return the DFT complex coefficient at the discrete Fourier frequency which is
the closest to `f`. The coefficient is computed for the time window starting
at `startAt` (one-based) and of lenght `wl`.

If `startAT`=1 (default) the first `wl` samples of the vector are considered.

`wl` does not need to be power of 2.

```julia
using FourierAnalysis
sr, t, f, a = 128, 128, 5, 10
v=sinusoidal(a, f, sr, t, 0)
c=goertzel(v, f, sr, t) # should output 0+aim
```

Fast version of the [`goertzel`](@ref) function to be preferred if the function
is invoked repeatedly and speed is of concern. The user provides as arguments:

- a time series as input vector `x`,
- `wl`, the number of samples in `x` (or the window length),
- `a` = ``2/wl``,
- `c` = ``cos(p)`` where ``p``=`2*π*round(UInt16, (f*wl)/sr)/wl`, ``f`` is the desired frequency and ``sr`` the sampling rate,
- `s` = ``sin(p)``
- `d` = 2*`c`
- `startAt` as in the [`goertzel`](@ref) function.

Like the [`goertzel`](@ref) function, but allows estimating the DFT coefficient
in the whole positive real line up to the Nyquist frequency.
This is useful when the DFT coefficient is sought
for a frequency which is not a discrete Fourier Frequency.

Using an appropriate taper this function allows almost exact recovery of
both amplitude and phase at all frequencies in case of one sinusoid,
whereas the `goertzel` function can do so only at exact Fourier discrete
frequencies.

using FourierAnalysis
sr, t, f, a = 128, 128, 5, 10
ftrue=f+0.15
v=sinusoidal(a, ftrue, sr, t, 0 )
c=goertzel(v, f, sr, t) # should be 0+aim, but clearly fails
