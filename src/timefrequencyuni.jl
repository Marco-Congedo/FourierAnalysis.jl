**alias**: mamp

(1)

Given a [TFAmplitudeVector](@ref) object, estimate the
[(weighted) mean amplitude](@ref) measure across those objects.
The time-frequency planes of all the objects in `ùêÄ` should be congruent.

**arguments**:

`frange` and `trange` define a time-frequency region on which the estimation
is sought. `frange` is a [fInterval](@ref) type
and delimits center frequencies of the filter bank. `trange` is a
[tInterval](@ref) type and delimits time samples. To obtain the estimation
in the whole time-frequency plane use the column (:) sign for both arguments.

**optional keyword arguments**

If `mode=extract` is passed (default), the measure will be computed
for all points in the chosen time-frequency region. If `mode=mean` is passed,
it will be computed on the mean of these points (grand-average).
The [`extract`](@ref) and [`mean`](@ref) functions are
[generic methods](@ref) of *FourierAnalysis*.

**Note**: with `mode=mean` the output of the function is always a real number,
whereas with `mode=extract` the output may be a real number, a real
row or column vector or a real matrix, depending on the shape of the
chosen time-frequency region.

Passing a function with the `func` argument you can
[derive your own time-frequency measures](@ref).

`w` may be a vector of non-negative real weights associated to
each input object. By default the unweighted version of the measure
is computed.

If `check` is true (default), check that if the column sign is passed
- as `frange` argument, all input objects have the same number of rows (center frequencies);
- as `trange` argument, all input objects have the same number of columns (time samples).
If either check fails, print an error message and return `Nothing`.
No other range checks are performed.

(2)

Given a [TFAnalyticSignalVector](@ref) object, compute the amplitude
of all objects in `ùêô` and estimate the [(weighted) mean amplitude](@ref)
measure across those objects as per method (1). In addition,
since using this method all [TFAnalyticSignal](@ref) in `ùêô` must be `linear`,
if `check` is true (default) and this is not the case,
print an error and return `Nothing`. The checks on `frange` and `trange`
performed by method (1) are also performed by this method.

(3)

Estimate the amplitude of all data vectors in `ùê±` calling the
[`TFamplitude`](@ref) constructor and then estimate the
[(weighted) mean amplitude](@ref) measure across the constructed
amplitude objects as per method (1).

`frange`, `trange`, `mode`, `func`, `w` and `check` have the same meaning as
in method (1). The other arguments are passed to the
[`TFamplitude`](@ref) constructor, to which the reader is referred
for their meaning.

h=taper(harris4, t)
ùê±=[sinusoidal(2, 10, sr, t, 0).*h.y+randn(t) for i=1:100]

# mean amplitude in a TF region from a TFAmplitudeVector object
MAmp=meanAmplitude(ùêÄ, (4, 16), :)

# mean amplitude in a TF region directly from data
MAmp=meanAmplitude(ùê±, sr, t, (4, 16), :, bandwidth)

# NB: in the above, the analytic signal objects must all
# be linear, since meanAmplitude is computed from amplitude
# and the amplitude of non-linear analytic signal is uniformy equal to 1.

# All these computations can be obtained averaging in a TF region, e.g.,
MAmp=meanAmplitude(ùêò, (4, 16), :; mode=mean) # output a real number

# and can be obtained on smoothed Amplitude, e.g.,
MAmp=meanAmplitude(ùê±, sr, t, (4, 16), :;
                   fsmoothing=blackmanSmoother,
                   tsmoothing=blackmanSmoother)
# or, equivalently, and using the alias `mamp`,
MAmp=mamp(smooth(blackmanSmoother, blackmanSmoother, ùêÄ), (4, 16), :)

# A similar syntax is used for the other univariate measures, e.g.,
# concentration averaging in a TF region from a TFAnalyticSignalVector object
ConM=concentration(ùêò, (4, 16), (128, 384); mode=mean)

# concentration in a TF region directly from data (using the alias `con`)
ConE=con(ùê±, sr, t, (4, 16), (128, 384), bandwidth; mode=extract)
heatmap(Con; c=:fire) # y axis labels are not correct

NB: ConM is not at all equivalent to mean(ConE) !

# mean direction averaging in a TF region directly from data
MDir=meanDirection(ùê±, sr, t, (4, 16), :, bandwidth; mode=mean)

# mean direction in a TF region from a TFAnalyticSignalVector object
MDir=meanDirection(ùêò, (4, 16), :)

# and for the non-linear counterpart:
# phase concentration in a TF region directly from data
Con=concentration(ùê±, sr, t, (8, 12), :; nonlinear=true)

# phase concentration at a single TF point
Con=concentration(ùê±, sr, t, 10, 256; nonlinear=true)

# phase mean direction averaging in a TF region directly from data
# and using the alias `mdir`
MDir=mdir(ùê±, sr, t, (8, 12), :; mode=mean, nonlinear=true)

# If you try to compute a non-linear measure from a linear
# AnalyticSignal object you will get en error (see the REPL), e.g.,
Con=con(ùêò, (8, 12), (1, 512); mode=mean, nonlinear=true)

# In order to compute non-linear measures from analytic signal objects
# first we need to compute non-linear analytic signal objects:
ùêò=TFanalyticsignal(ùê±, sr, t, bandwidth; fmax=32, nonlinear=true)

# then, we can obtain for example the phase concentration
Con=con(ùêò, (8, 12), :; mode=mean, nonlinear=true)

# and the phase mean direction

**alias**: con

If optional keyword parameter `nonlinear` is false (default),
estimate the [(weighted) concentration](@ref) measure,
otherwise estimate the [(weighted) phase concentration](@ref) measure.

(1)
The desired measure is obtained averaging across the
[TFAnalyticSignal](@ref) objects in `ùêô`. Since this method uses
pre-computed analytic signal objects, their `.nonlinear` field
must agree with the `nonlinear` argument passed to
this function.

`frange`, `trange`, `w`, `mode` and `func` have the same meaning as
in the [`meanAmplitude`](@ref) function, however keep in mind that
the two possible `mode` functions, i.e.,
[`extract`](@ref) and [`mean`](@ref), in this function operate on
complex numbers.

The checks performed in the [`meanAmplitude`](@ref) function
are performed here too. In addition, if `check` is true, also check that
- if `nonlinear` is true, all objects in `ùêô` are nonlinear;
- if `nonlinear` is false, all objects in `ùêô` are linear.
If either check fails, print an error message and return `Nothing`.

(2)
Estimate the analytic signal of all data vectors in `ùê±` calling the
[`TFanalyticsignal`](@ref) constructor and then use method (1)
to obtained the desired measure.

`frange`, `trange`, `mode`, `func`, `w` and `check` have the same meaning as
in the [`meanAmplitude`](@ref) function.
The other arguments are passed to the [`TFanalyticsignal`](@ref) constructor,
to which the reader is referred for understanding their action.

This function features two methods that use exactly the same syntax
as the two corresponding methods of the [`concentration`](@ref) function.
All arguements have exactly the same meaning as therein.
Only the output differs:

if optional keyword parameter `nonlinear` is false (default),
estimate the [(weighted) mean direction](@ref) measure,
otherwise estimate the [(weighted) phase mean direction](@ref) measure.

**alias**: mdir

**See also**: [`meanAmplitude`](@ref), [`concentration`](@ref),
[timefrequencybi.jl](@ref).

**Examples**: see the examples of [`meanAmplitude`](@ref).
